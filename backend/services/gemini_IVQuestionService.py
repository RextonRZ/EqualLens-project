        Required Skills: {', '.join(required_skills)}
        Description: {job_description}

        Create a structured interview plan with the following 7 sections:

        SECTION 1: GENERAL QUESTIONS
        - Include an introduction question that asks the candidate to introduce themselves
        - Ask about strengths and weaknesses relevant to the job
        - Reference specific details from the candidate's resume but don't clash with section 3
        - Make all these questions compulsory with appropriate time limits
        - 3 compulsory questions and 0 optional question

        SECTION 2: JOB-SPECIFIC QUESTIONS
        - Ask why they applied for this specific position
        - Question their fit for the role based on job requirements
        - Include technical questions directly related to the required skills
        - Include questions related to the job description
        - Mix compulsory and optional questions with varying time limits

        SECTION 3: RESUME-BASED QUESTIONS
        - Test technical skills mentioned in their resume
        - Ask about work experiences listed
        - Question certifications/achievements they've included
        - Explore soft skills evident in their background
        - Include questions about co-curricular activities if relevant
        - Set appropriate compulsory/optional status and time limits
        - Reference specific details from the candidate's resume and job description
        - Mix compulsory and optional questions with varying time limits

        SECTION 4: BEHAVIORAL QUESTIONS
        - Include problem-solving scenarios relevant to the role reference to the job description
        - Ask about past work challenges and their resolution reference to candidate's resume
        - Explore team collaboration experiences to specific details from the candidate's resume and job description
        - Include conflict resolution scenarios 
        - Ask about leadership and initiative examples reference to specific details from the candidate's resume and job description
        - Make 8 optional questions without any compulsory questions

        SECTION 5: FUTURE OUTLOOK AND CAREER ASPIRATIONS
        - Ask about career development expectations
        - Explore professional growth plans
        - Question learning and skill enhancement objectives
        - Discuss long-term career trajectory
        - Assess willingness to adapt and learn
        - Set appropriate time limits and compulsory status

        SECTION 6: COMPENSATION AND LOGISTICS
        - Ask about salary expectations
        - Inquire about availability for joining
        - Question notice period from current employer
        - Discuss relocation willingness if relevant
        - Ask about work schedule preferences
        - Explore remote/hybrid work adaptability
        - Make most questions optional with appropriate time limits

        SECTION 7: CLOSING AND CANDIDATE QUESTIONS
        - Allow candidate to ask questions about the role
        - Ask question related to clarifications about job responsibilities
        - Provide a final opportunity for candidate self-promotion
        - Create exactly 3 optional questions with no compulsory questions
        - Set random selection to pick exactly 1 question from these 3 options

        FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
        - For each section, provide 5-8 relevant questions (instead of just 3-5)
        - For each question, specify a time limit between 30-140 seconds
        - Mark approximately 40% of the questions as compulsory (true) and 60% as optional (false)
        - For each section, enable random selection by default
        - Set random selection to pick at least 2 non-compulsory questions, but not all of them
        - For SECTION 7, make sure to set random selection to pick exactly 1 question
        - Format your response as a valid JSON object with the following structure:

        {{
          "sections": [
            {{
              "title": "Section Title",
              "questions": [
                {{
                  "text": "Question text",
                  "timeLimit": 60,
                  "isCompulsory": true
                }}
              ],
              "randomSettings": {{
                "enabled": true,
                "count": 2
              }}
            }}
          ]
        }}

        IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
        - Ensure each question is specifically tailored to both the candidate's experience and job requirements
        - Don't include generic questions that could apply to any job
        - Assign reasonable time limits based on question complexity (30-150 seconds)
        - Only enable random selection for sections with at least 3 non-compulsory questions
        - Set random selection counts to at least 2 questions, but not more than 70% of the available non-compulsory questions
        - For SECTION 7, create exactly 3 optional questions with random selection enabled to pick exactly 1 question
        - Include a balanced mix of compulsory and optional questions
        - Ensure the interview duration is reasonable (typically 20-40 minutes total)
        - Make sure the response is a valid JSON object with no additional text

        Now, create a comprehensive, personalized interview question set following these guidelines.
